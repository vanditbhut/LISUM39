# To complete the project, I began by cloning the VC repository from the provided link. After successfully cloning it, I created a new branch and switched to this newly created branch. Next, I ran the add.py script and provided my name and favorite sport as inputs when prompted. Subsequently, I executed the test script using the command pytest test/test.py -s, ensuring to ignore any warnings. Since there were no errors, I proceeded to add my changes to the staging area, committed them with a meaningful message, and pushed the changes to the repository. Finally, I created a pull request on GitHub and assigned it to a reviewer for further evaluation.
